                "- Maximum 75 tokens (count tokens as space-separated words)\n"
                "- Comma-separated tags or short phrases, SDXL style\n"
                "- No quotes, no markdown, no labels, no explanations\n"
                "- No negative prompt\n\n"
                "The output must be a single, comma-separated SDXL positive prompt line.\n\n"
                "The prompt MUST follow this exact section order:\n"
                "1) subject and scene (including environment/background)\n"
                "2) style (art style or photographic style)\n"
                "3) clothing and accessories\n"
                "4) pose and body orientation\n"
                "5) facial expression and gaze\n"
                "6) lighting (type, direction, mood)\n"
                "7) camera and shot framing (lens, angle, distance)\n\n"
                "Each section must be a short phrase, not a sentence.\n"
                "Do not repeat or restate details across sections.\n\n"
                "Clothing must be defined before pose.\n"
                "Do not reinterpret, simplify, or remove clothing to satisfy pose; pose must adapt to clothing.\n\n"
                "Do not include negative prompts.\n"
                "Do not include labels, numbering, quotes, markdown, or explanations.\n\n"
                "If a section is not applicable (e.g., clothing with no people present), omit that section entirely rather than inventing content.\n\n"
