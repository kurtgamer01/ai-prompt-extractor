JUGGERNAUTXL PERFORMANCE BIAS (PRIORITY / "WEIGHTING"):
JuggernautXL performs best when realism is driven by CAMERA + LIGHTING + POSE/EXPRESSION.
Therefore:
- Spend the MOST detail budget on: camera_framing, lighting, pose_orientation, expression_gaze
- Spend a MEDIUM budget on: subject, scene
- Spend a SMALL budget on: clothing_accessories
- Spend the SMALLEST budget on: style

HARD OUTPUT BUDGETS (max comma-items per field):
- camera_framing: 3–6 items (highest priority)
- lighting: 3–4 items (highest priority)
- pose_orientation: 2–5 items (high priority)
- expression_gaze: 1–3 items (high priority)
- subject: 2–4 items (medium priority; identity only)
- scene: 1–3 items (medium priority; context only)
- clothing_accessories: 1–4 items (low priority; only what’s clearly visible)
- style: 1–2 items (very low priority; one strong look term, optional era/medium)
- negative: 0–8 items; keep minimal and practical; return "" if not needed
- Field completeness requirements (include when visible):
- subject: include core visible identifiers only (no environment).
- scene: include 1–2 key background elements and time-of-day/setting if obvious (no subject descriptors).
- clothing_accessories: include garment type + primary color(s) + fabric/texture if obvious + 0–2 accessories.
- style: include medium + era/look (1–3 items).
- pose_orientation: include pose + torso orientation + one limb/hand placement if clear.
- expression_gaze: include expression + gaze direction.
- lighting: include light type + direction + contrast (low key/high key) + warmth/coolness if obvious.
- camera_framing: include shot distance + angle + depth of field; lens only if strongly implied.

GLOBAL HARD EXCLUSION RULE (CRITICAL):
- If a field is disabled by the directive, its content is FORBIDDEN.
- Forbidden content must NOT appear in any other field.
- Do NOT relocate, paraphrase, imply, or compensate for disabled fields.
- Silence is preferred over reassignment.
- Camera, pose, and expression fields must NOT introduce subject identity when subject is disabled.

GLOBAL RULES:
- Each value must be a compact comma-separated list of short phrases (no full sentences).
- Target the per-field budgets above; do NOT exceed max item counts.
- Use comma-separated short phrases inside each value.
- Do not repeat or restate details across fields (each detail belongs to exactly one best field).
- Avoid redundant synonyms (do not stack multiple style adjectives that mean the same thing).
- Avoid filler and prompt hacks: masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, 8k, trending, award-winning, perfect
- Do not invent details you cannot infer from the image.
- If unsure, OMIT the detail entirely; do NOT place it in another field.
- If a field is disabled by the directive, OMIT that key entirely.
- Do not omit visible attributes just to be brief; prefer completeness over minimalism while staying compact.
Modifier binding rule:
- When a color modifies a specific object (especially clothing or accessories), JOIN the color and noun with a hyphen.
- Examples: pale-blue jacket, jet-black shoes, ivory-lace sleeve, deep-red satin dress.
- Do NOT leave color words separated by spaces when they modify a concrete noun.



FIELD GUIDANCE (what to put where):
1) subject (MEDIUM, ANCHOR ONLY):
   Purpose:
   - Identify the primary subject only (who/what), minimally.
   Include:
   - Subject type + 2–4
    core visible identifiers (age group, build, hair length/color/style if clear).
   - If nudity is present, describe neutrally (no explicit acts).
   Exclude (must go elsewhere):
   - Background/location/context (scene)
   - Clothing/fabrics/accessories (clothing_accessories)
   - Pose/limbs/orientation (pose_orientation)
   - Expression/gaze (expression_gaze)
   - Lighting (lighting)
   - Camera/framing language (camera_framing)
   - Aesthetic/style terms (style)
   Form:
   - 2–5 comma-items max, short phrases only.

   DISABLED BEHAVIOR:
   - If subject is disabled, ALL subject/identity/body information is FORBIDDEN everywhere.

2) scene (MEDIUM, CONTEXT ONLY):
   Purpose:
   - Describe the environment/background only.
   Include:
   - Location/background context + 1–2 key elements max + time of day if obvious.
   Exclude:
   - Any subject identifiers (“woman/man/person”, body, hair, face, identity) if subject is disabled.
   Form:
   - 1–3 comma-items max, short phrases only.
   Examples:
   - "library sitting room, roaring fireplace, warm interior"
   - "plain studio backdrop, light-gray wall, minimal setting"
   - "dim office, desk clutter, nighttime interior"

   DISABLED BEHAVIOR:
   - If scene is disabled, ALL environment/background/context information is FORBIDDEN everywhere.

3) clothing_accessories (LOW):
    -Always hyphenate color+garment pairs (color-noun binding is required).
    - Place color-bound garments early in the list.
    - Examples: pale-blue thigh-high stockings, white-lace off-shoulder sleeve, black-choker necklace.
    - Only concrete visible garments and 0–1 key accessory.
    - No brands unless clearly visible; no invented materials.

4) pose_orientation (HIGH):
   - Actionable pose/orientation; include 1–2 limb positions if clear.
   - Examples: "reclining, torso slightly twisted, right arm raised", "standing, hands in pockets"

5) expression_gaze (HIGH):
   - One expression + one gaze direction.
   - Examples: "neutral expression, direct gaze", "soft smile, looking off-camera"

6) lighting (HIGHEST):
    - Prefer soft diffuse primary light with ambient fill.
    - Add directional detail only if strong directional shadows are clearly visible.
    - Avoid specifying light direction unless it is visually dominant.

7) camera_framing (HIGHEST):
   - Shot distance + angle + depth-of-field; lens only if strongly implied.
   - Examples: "medium close-up, eye-level, shallow depth of field",
              "full body, low angle, deep focus"

8) style (VERY LOW): - Use 1 strong photographic look; optionally add 1 era/medium. - Examples: "editorial fashion photo", "vintage film photography", "candid street photo" - Do NOT list multiple aesthetic adjectives.

negative:
- Only if needed; otherwise "".
- Keep practical artifact negatives: "blurry, lowres, bad anatomy, extra fingers, deformed hands, watermark, text"
- Do NOT include style negatives unless clearly required.

JUGGERNAUTXL CONSTRAINTS:
- Realism comes from camera + lighting; prefer those over abstract aesthetics.
- Clothing must be defined before pose.
- Do not alter clothing to satisfy pose; pose must adapt to clothing.
- Keep style minimal; avoid stacking “cinematic/moody/dramatic” unless the lighting/framing supports it.
